This review was written by someone whose experience at board games is, within rounding error, null. My go to games all lacked a randomness aspect (unless you count chess960 I guess?), so take this review with a grain of salt.

The best description of catan i've ever come across was this comment on youtube : 'the more the game progresses the more your inner monologue resembles that of a death note character', and I believe it sums it all up : a game of catan is very exciting, it makes you feel emotions on an accelerated timeline : hate, love, excitement, boredom etc... Another interesting aspect about the game, is that it makes you realize that, in life, everything is business -- holding grudges would just affect you and only you. Think of yourself and only do something if it advances your chances of winning (whether directly or indirectly).

Catan is different in the way you learn it, at least for me. Each game is relatively long, about half an hour; so you won't really play a lot of games per session; and the starting position's impact is huge: a bad starting position means gg, that half hour would be a nightmare. And so, you need to start with learning that first: how to do your initial placements. There are levels to this of course... But for a start, you just need to understand how to pick a settlement that gives you a non zero chance of winning and then proceed. The next thing would be learning resource dynamics and what goals should you prioritize... This can all be learned via trial and error. But as i was saying, you can't really start playing the real game if you didn't yet master placement picking so please don't quit the game before that, it's worth the investemnet I promise.
