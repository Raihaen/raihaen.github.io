Why do we write? Such an eternal question... And with multiple great answers, a personal favourite of mine is [evan chen's post](https://blog.evanchen.cc/2015/03/14/writing/), which is obviously also inspired by other posts; and this leads me to my first point : writing is just re-itterating ideas we have, we're only recalling infos we already have (and that we could recall).

However, what intrests me most in writing, is mainly **not** above, it's more of a personal reason really, writing makes me think in a (loosely) bounded space, "forcing" me to finsh-off argument I would've left as exercise to my future-self.
