This is my first ever puzzle review. I'm trying to document a few of my favourits, and what better way to start than by a Jack Lance game ?

This was a very "cursed puzzle", the first levels are very classic, but you eventually start seeing some weird stuff... [Here is the link to the game](https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=2fe3172d2b9fe684977d184f1b6226d5).

**Number of levels :** 12. 
**Mark :** 9/10.

**SPOILER AHEAD**

What I love about this game, and JL's games in general, is that there's always a surprise element to it, he is very creative and loves to "push" concepts to their limits. He took push mechanics to a whole new level, the more cursed the game gets the more appearent his genius is, always taking puzzlescript to new horizons.

I however feel like the diagonal push mechanic could've been exploited more, as its puzzles felt more like a 'hey look at this cursed thing' instead of being a challenge; even the last level felt like just spamming the same mechanic without a novel idea. I understand however that this is very hard (maybe not even possible) due to its glitchy nature.

I really recommend this game.
The levels i found the hardest are : Level 5, level 7 and level 6. Please share your thoughts if you've ever played it.
